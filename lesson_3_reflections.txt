When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?

  In my case, it is useful because I have been completing this course on both my desktop and laptop interchangably, 
  a remote repository will enable me to keep repositories on both my machines identical.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If the remote repository is public, automatic updates could result in part of your code changing somewhere you weren't expecting, resulting in a bug. It lets you merge when you are confident that your code is working.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Clones someone elses repository on GitHub. More efficient than cloning directly to your files, and gives them credit, nd allows you to suggest changes to the original repository.

    Clone: When credit or changes aren't necessary to the original rep.

    Branch: Contained within a repository, use when you want to make an experimental change.
